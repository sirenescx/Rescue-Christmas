## Game mechanics and operating
* Actor moving all the time without player input.
* Moving between tracks – Thumbstick Right/Left.
* Interaction with objects: collecting coins, extra lives, gingerbreads (restore health) by picking them up automatically when the player is nearby.
* Throwing snowballs at enemies using controllers – Trigger.
* At the very beginning the player has 3 lives. After collision with the obstacle or an enemy snowball hits, the player loses part of his Health Points (50 HP), after he loses all HP, he loses one of his lives. He can restore health via gingerbread (but not life). He can restore life via extra heart on his ride. After he lost all his life the game is over.

## Level design
Endless run. The character runs endlessly, in the process he stops from time to time and starts at a higher speed. 
The level is designed so that:
* The track is generated procedurally.
* Difficulty increases gradually by increasing the frequency of objects and enemies.
* There are obstacles that the player must switch the path. 
* Every 50-100 metres there are enemies who shoot. They need to be knocked down by throwing snowballs. 

## Artificial Intelligence
Snowmen (common NPC)
Snowmen are characters who appear regularly along the track. He can be beaten by one snowball. 
NPC can:
* Attack – throw a snowball at the character, the character must dodge (go to another path or he will lose health)
* Die after attack
